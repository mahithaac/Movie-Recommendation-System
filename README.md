# 🎬 MovieLens Data Analysis & Recommendation Project

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and initial recommendation logic on the MovieLens 100K dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/). It demonstrates basic data science skills like data preprocessing, visualization, and understanding user behavior.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `project1_movieRating.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full code
- `movies.dat`, `ratings.dat`, `users.dat` – Raw MovieLens dataset files

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Loading and cleaning raw `.dat` files using pandas.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to explore:
  - Most rated movies
  - Ratings distribution by age
  - Gender based Rating Distribution System
  - Movie genres
- Understand patterns that can inform a recommendation system.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Google Colab** (for running notebooks in the cloud)


## 📊 Key Insights
- Successfully loaded and parsed raw `.dat` files from the MovieLens dataset using `pandas`.
- Merged user, movie, and rating data to form a comprehensive dataset.
- Visualized rating distribution using histograms.
- Demonstrated basic EDA such as the count of ratings per movie.

## 📌 How to Run

1. Download or clone this repo
2. Open `project1_movieRating.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Upload the three `.dat` files (`movies.dat`, `ratings.dat`, `users.dat`)
4. Run all cells
